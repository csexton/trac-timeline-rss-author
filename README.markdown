Timeline RSS Author Hack
========================

This all started because Mail.app does not show the author tag when rss feeds are in the inbox. And after trying to 'fix' mail, I gave up and edited trac's timeline template.  It was an easy change and thought other people might find it useful. 

I commited the original file from Trac 10.4 and applied my patch and commited again.  It should be trivial to create the patch from the history, or go over to trac-hacks.org and download the patch I attached to the wiki page.

See the project page on [trac-hacks.org](http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/TimelineRssAuthorPatch).
